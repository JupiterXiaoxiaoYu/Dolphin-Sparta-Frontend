## Dolphin Sparta Ranch: Rise of the Ocean Warriors

Welcome to an enchanting underwater realm where you'll step into the fins of Poseidon, a legendary dolphin warrior, as you build and train your own elite force of aquatic champions. In this unique marine management adventure, you'll nurture young dolphins from their earliest days, guiding them through their journey from playful calves to mighty warriors of the sea.

Train both Spear and Sword Dolphins, each with unique abilities and fighting styles, as they prepare to face the game's ultimate challenge - the menacing Evil Whale that threatens the peace of the ocean. Manage your resources wisely, including food supplies and medicine, while monitoring your dolphins' satiety and health to keep them in prime fighting condition.

As your dolphins grow stronger and more numerous, you'll collect precious coins and expand your underwater ranch. But beware - the path to becoming a legendary marine warrior is filled with challenges. Your strategic decisions in training, healing, and deploying your dolphin warriors will determine the fate of the ocean realm.

Join the epic quest to build the most formidable underwater fighting force and restore peace to the seven seas!
